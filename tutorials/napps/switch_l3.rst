Creating an L3 learning switch
######################################

********
Overview
********
This tutorial will show the first steps to create an L3 learning switch NApp
using *Kytos* (|kytos|_).
The average time to go through this is: ``20 min``

What you will learn
====================
* How to unpack the Packet-In data looking for L3 information;
* How to install proactive flows in switches using Kytos.

What you will need
===================
* Your |dev_env|_ already up and running.
* The *kytos/of_core* NApp installed and enabled.
* To have finished the |l2_tutorial|_.

************
Introduction
************

Layer 3
=======
*Layer 3* refers to the *Network layer*, the third one in the |osi_model|_. This layer
is responsible for defining logical addresses and identification for network
devices.

The |ip_proto|_, used in the Internet for example, is the most relevant implementation
for this layer. IP addresses, like '192.168.10.1', are essentialy Layer 3 addresses.

The L3 learning switch
======================

The Layer 3 learning switch will operate similarly to the |l2ls|_,
but working with IP addresses instead of MAC addresses.

The *l3ls* NApp will learn at which port each IP address is, and install reactive
flows in switches to handle traffic based on source IP and destination IP. ARP
packets will be just flooded to the network, because they have different headers.

Is this a router?
=================

No. A router should be capable of switching packets between different networks, and
to actively communicate with hosts using protocols such as ARP and ICMP. We will cover
the steps to implement routing in future tutorials.

For this implementation of *l3ls*, we will consider that hosts are in the same logical
network.

.. NOTE:: We are also considering the addresses to be IPv4 addresses.

.. ATTENTION:: This NApp was designed for instructional purposes. Running it in
    production environments may lead to unwanted behavior.



******************
Creating your NApp
******************

First, create your NApp using the ``kytos`` command. Use your **<username>**
(the one you have just registered at github) as the username and 'of_l3ls' as the NApp name,
as follows (don't forget to create the ``~/tutorials`` folder if it does not exist):

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ~/tutorials
  $ kytos napps create
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Welcome to the bootstrap process of your NApp.
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  In order to answer both the username and the napp name,
  You must follow this naming rules:
   - name starts with a letter
   - name contains only letters, numbers or underscores
   - at least three characters
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  Please, insert your NApps Server username: <username>
  Please, insert your NApp name: of_l3ls
  Please, insert a brief description for your NApp [optional]: This NApp does packet switching using L3 information

  Congratulations! Your NApp have been bootstrapped!
  Now you can go to the directory <username>/of_l3ls and begin to code your NApp.
  Have fun!

Start copying the ``main.py`` file from the |l2_tutorial|_: you'll change it to
use L3 information instead of L2. Then, open it in your preferred editor to start
coding your NApp.

.. code-block:: console

  $ cp <username>/of_l2ls/main.py <username>/of_l3ls/main.py

Create an L3 switching table
============================

First of all, you will create an L3 table for each switch that connects to the
controller. When a new switch is connected, and completes the OpenFlow handshake *Kytos* generates a ``of_core.handshake.completed``
KytosEvent. Your NApp will have a method to deal with those.

The L3 table will be a Python dictionary, mapping IP addresses to switch ports.

.. code-block:: python3

  @listen_to("kytos/of_core.handshake.completed")
    def create_switching_table(self, event):
        switch = event.content["switch"]
        switch.l3_table = {}
      # (Continues...)


Deal with the ARP packets
=========================

When you perform packet switchin with L3 information, you have to deal separately with
ARP. ARP packets will be sent in the network with a source MAC and a destination MAC,
enabling the L2 learning switch to exchange them properly, but they have different
L3 headers and do not carry a source IP or destination IP.

The naive solution is to just flood ARP packets, in a 'hub-like' behavior, without even
sending them to the controller. While the L2 learning switch is only *reactive*, the
L3 switch will have *proactive* flows matching ARP.

.. code-block:: python3

  @listen_to("kytos/of_core.handshake.completed")
  def create_switching_table(self, event):
      switch = event.content["switch"]
      switch.l3_table = {}

      arp_flow_mod = FlowMod()
      arp_flow_mod.command = FlowModCommand.OFPFC_ADD
      arp_flow_mod.priority = 10000
      oxmtlv1 = OxmTLV(
          oxm_class=OxmClass.OFPXMC_OPENFLOW_BASIC,
          oxm_field=OxmOfbMatchField.OFPXMT_OFB_ETH_TYPE,
          oxm_hasmask=False,
          oxm_value=EtherType.ARP.value.to_bytes(2, "big"),
      )
      match = Match(match_type=MatchType.OFPMT_OXM, oxm_match_fields=[oxmtlv1])
      arp_flow_mod.match = match
      action_output = ActionOutput(port=PortNo.OFPP_FLOOD)
      instructions = [InstructionApplyAction([action_output])]
      arp_flow_mod.instructions = instructions
      event_out = KytosEvent(
          name=("<username>/of_l3ls.messages.out." "ofpt_flow_mod"),
          content={"destination": switch.connection, "message": arp_flow_mod},
      )
      self.controller.buffers.msg_out.put(event_out)


Change ``handle_packet_in`` to use L3 information
=================================================

Updating the L3 table
---------------------
To update the switch's L3 table, you need to get the IPV4 information of the
PacketIn sent to the controller. You'll do it with one more ``unpack`` on the
data field of the Ethernet frame. It's important to check if it is an IPV4 packet
before the unpack, to avoid errors. Once unpacked, you can add the source IP to the
L3 table. The needed changes are shown below:

.. code-block:: python3


  @listen_to("kytos/of_core.v0x04.messages.in.ofpt_packet_in")
  def handle_packet_in(self, event):
      packet_in = event.content["message"]

      ethernet = Ethernet()
      ethernet.unpack(packet_in.data.value)

      if ethernet.ether_type.value == EtherType.IPV4:
          ipv4 = IPv4()
          ipv4.unpack(ethernet.data.value)

          in_port = packet_in.in_port
          switch = event.source.switch
          dest_port = switch.l3_table.get(ipv4.destination)
          log.info(f"Packet received from {ipv4.source} to {ipv4.destination}.")


.. note:: All further code will be inside the above `if` statement. Check the
    final main.py file in case of doubt.


Final main.py file
==================

Now your ``main.py`` file shall look like the one below. Here we have all the
needed imports, and comments were removed to improve readability.

*****************************
Running and testing your NApp
*****************************

To run your NApp, you need to run *Kytos* first to enable NApp management. In
another terminal window, make sure to activate your |dev_env|_ and run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kytosd -f

  (...)

  kytos $>

As you can see, there is a log line indicating that *kytos/of_core* is running.
You need the OpenFlow core NApp installed and enabled. It is possible to check
it by running, in the previous terminal window:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kytos napps list

  Status |          NApp ID          |                     Description

If the NApp is installed but not enabled, you can enable it by running:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kytos napps enable kytos/of_core

In order to run your NApp, you can install it locally or remotely:

To install locally, you have to run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ~/tutorials/<username>/of_l3ls
  $ python3 setup.py develop

To install remotely, you have to publish it first. Follow the instructions in this |link|_ to publish as well as install your NApp.

Now that you have published your NApps, You can now see your NApp installed and enabled, by running the command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ~/tutorials
  $ kytos napps install <username>/of_l3ls
  INFO  NApp <username>/of_l3ls:
  INFO    Searching local NApp...
  INFO    Found and installed.
  INFO    Enabling...
  INFO    Enabled.

With the NApp installed and enabled, you can run Mininet to see it in action:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo mn -c ; sudo mn --controller remote --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow10

.. IMPORTANT:: As no specific topology configuration was passed to Mininet, it
    will generate a virtual network with a switch connecting two hosts, 10.0.0.1
    and 10.0.0.2.

.. ATTENTION:: Just like the l2ls implementation, this NApp will NOT work in
    topologies containing loops. However, it works with linear and tree topologies.

Now, in the Mininet console, run:

.. code-block:: console

  mininet> h1 ping h2
  PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=83.3 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=66.6 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.495 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.117 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.114 ms

The pings are sucessful! Communication between the hosts is possible because the
*of_l3ls* NApp has dealt with the Flows. You can check it by looking at the controller
logs:

.. code-block:: console

  2017-07-25 16:04:07,150 - INFO [<username>/of_l3ls] (Thread-88) Packet received from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2.

  2017-07-25 16:04:08,163 - INFO [<username>/of_l3ls] (Thread-94) Flow installed! Subsequent packets will be sent directly.

Once the flows are set in both directions, the switch sends the packets direclty.
Good job!
