Creating an L2 learning switch
##############################

********
Overview
********
This tutorial will show you how to create an L2 learning switch NApp
using *Kytos* (|kytos|_).
The average time to go through this is: ``25 min``

What you will learn
====================
* How to capture OpenFlow Packet-In events;
* How to unpack the Packet-In data looking for L2 information;
* How to install flows in a switch.

What you will need
===================
* Your |dev_env|_ already up and running.
* The *kytos/of_core* NApp installed and enabled.

************
Introduction
************

Layer 2
=======
*Layer 2* refers to the *Data Link layer*, the second one in the |osi_model|_. This layer
is responsible for defining interfaces's fixed addresses for transmitting frames
in a network as well as control the Physical layer.

The |ethernet|_ standard is widely adopted for |lans|_, and will be used in this
tutorial.

The L2 learning switch
======================

The Layer 2 learning switch must be able to exchange frames between devices in
the network automatically, identifying interfaces by their |macs|_, learning where
each one is located and installing reactive flows in switches, handling the traffic
based on the source/destination MACs.


******************
Creating your NApp
******************

First, create your NApp using the ``kytos`` command. Use use your **<username>**
(your GitHub username) as the username and 'of_l2ls' as the NApp name,
as follows (don't forget to create the ``~/tutorials`` folder if it does not exist):

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ~/tutorials
  $ kytos napps create
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Welcome to the bootstrap process of your NApp.
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  In order to answer both the username and the napp name,
  You must follow this naming rules:
   - name starts with a letter
   - name contains only letters, numbers or underscores
   - at least three characters
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  Please, insert your NApps Server username: <username>
  Please, insert your NApp name: of_l2ls
  Please, insert a brief description for your NApp [optional]: This NApp does packet switching using L2 information

  Congratulations! Your NApp have been bootstrapped!
  Now you can go to the directory <username>/of_l2ls and begin to code your NApp.
  Have fun!

Open the ``main.py`` file in your preferred editor to start coding your NApp.

.. ATTENTION:: Some classes and methods used in the code snippets need to be imported
    in your main.py file. Please check the full content of the file and import these
    elements as needed.


Update switching table with incoming packets
============================================

In this first step, you will create a method to handle PacketIn events. A PacketIn is
generated everytime the switchs sends a packet to the controller for analysis.

The method has a decorator to listen to *packet in* events. It unpacks the
``packet_in.data`` into an Ethernet instance.

Once you have the Ethernet header information, you can use it to update the
switching table, associating it with the *in_port* - the physical switch
interface where the packet came from.

You can also add a log message to know when the controller receives a packet.

.. code-block:: python3

    @listen_to('kytos/of_core.v0x04.messages.in.ofpt_packet_in')
    def handle_packet_in(self, event):
        packet_in = event.content['message']

        ethernet = Ethernet()
        ethernet.unpack(packet_in.data.value)

        in_port = packet_in.in_port.value
        switch = event.source.switch
        switch.update_mac_table(ethernet.source, in_port)
        log.info('Packet received from %s to %s.', ethernet.source.value,
                 ethernet.destination.value)

            # (Continues...)

Create Flow Mods for MAC addresses
==================================

The next step is to check if the switch already knows from which port the destination
address is reachable. You will look for it using the ``where_is_mac`` method.

If the switch does know where the packet shall go to, then you will install a Flow in it so
new packets with the same source and destination addresses will be directly and
correctly forwarded, without needing the controller.
The Flow will instruct the switch to handle those new packets himself.

Your Flow Mod message shall have:
 - A Flow Mod Command: as this is a new Flow, the command is OFPFC_ADD;
 - A Flow Match: A match has all information you want the switch to check before
   deciding if the packet belongs to this particular flow. You want the switch to match the
   source MAC address, the destination MAC address and the Ethernet type;
 - A list of Actions: All the actions to be performed on the incoming packet are
   executed by the switch. Given this is a switching NApp, you want the switch
   to send the packet through the correct port, defined by the controller.

.. note:: You can add more restrictions to your OpenFlow Match, like the VLAN ID
    or PCP if your environment needs that.

Once you have prepared the Flow Mod, create a KytosEvent containing it directed to the switch
that sent you the PacketIn, and put this event in the ``msg_out`` buffer.

.. code-block:: python3

    @listen_to('kytos/of_core.v0x04.messages.in.ofpt_packet_in')
    def handle_packet_in(self, event):
        # (...)

        dest_ports = switch.where_is_mac(ethernet.destination)

        if dest_ports:
            log.info('%s is at port %d.', ethernet.destination.value, dest_ports[0])
            flow_mod = FlowMod()
            flow_mod.command = FlowModCommand.OFPFC_ADD
            flow_mod.match = Match()
            flow_mod.match.nw_src = ethernet.source.value
            flow_mod.match.nw_dst = ethernet.destination.value
            flow_mod.match.dl_type = ethernet.ether_type
            # Example: matching the VLAN ID 200:
            # flow_mod.match.dl_vlan = 200
            flow_mod.actions.append(ActionOutput(port=dest_ports[0]))
            event_out = KytosEvent(name=('<username>/of_l2ls.messages.out.'
                                         'ofpt_flow_mod'),
                                   content={'destination': event.source,
                                            'message': flow_mod})
            self.controller.buffers.msg_out.put(event_out)
            log.info('Flow installed! Subsequent packets will be sent directly.')

        # (Continues...)

Send the packet back to the network
===================================

Whether your switch found a destination or not, the flow installed on the previous
step will work only for new incoming packets. There is still need to handle this
particular packet that generated the PacketIn event.

Create a PacketOut with the content of the PacketIn (same buffer_id, in_port
and data). If the controller knows the packet destination, then you can send it
right away through the proper port. If the controller does not know it, then tell
the switch to *flood* the packet: send it to all ports except the in_port.

Once again, create a KytosEvent and put it in the ``msg_out`` buffer.

.. code-block:: python3

    @listen_to('kytos/of_core.v0x04.messages.in.ofpt_packet_in')
    def handle_packet_in(self, event):
        # (...)

        if dest_ports:
            # (...)

        packet_out = PacketOut()
        packet_out.buffer_id = packet_in.buffer_id
        packet_out.in_port = packet_in.in_port
        packet_out.data = packet_in.data

        port = dest_ports[0] if dest_ports else Port.OFPP_FLOOD
        packet_out.actions.append(ActionOutput(port=port))
        event_out = KytosEvent(name=('<username>/of_l2ls.messages.out.'
                                     'ofpt_packet_out'),
                               content={'destination': event.source,
                                        'message': packet_out})

        self.controller.buffers.msg_out.put(event_out)


Final main.py file
==================

Now your ``main.py`` file shall look like the one below. Here we have all the
needed imports, and comments were removed to improve readability.

.. code-block:: python3

              event_out = KytosEvent(name=('<username>/of_l2ls.messages.out.'
                                           'ofpt_flow_mod'),
                                     content={'destination': event.source,
                                              'message': flow_mod})
              self.controller.buffers.msg_out.put(event_out)
              log.info('Flow installed! Subsequent packets will be sent directly.')

          packet_out = PacketOut()

      def shutdown(self):
          pass


*****************************
Running and testing your NApp
*****************************

To run your NApp, you need to run *Kytos* first to enable NApp management. In
another terminal window, make sure to activate your |dev_env|_ and run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kytosd -f

  (...)

  kytos $>

As you can see, there is a log line indicating that *kytos/of_core* is running.
You need the OpenFlow core NApp installed and enabled. It is possible to check
it by running, in the previous terminal window:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kytos napps list

  Status |          NApp ID          |                     Description

If the NApp is installed but not enabled, you can enable it by running:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kytos napps enable kytos/of_core

In order to run your NApp, you can install it locally or remotely:

To install locally, you have to run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ~/tutorials/<username>/of_l2ls
  $ python3 setup.py develop

To install remotely, you have to publish it first.

Follow the intructions in this |Link|_ to publish your Napp

Now that you have published your NApp, install and run it:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ~/tutorials
  $ kytos napps install <username>/of_l2ls
  INFO  NApp <username>/of_l2ls:
  INFO    Searching local NApp...
  INFO    Found and installed.
  INFO    Enabling...
  INFO    Enabled.

With the NApp installed and enabled, you can run Mininet to see it in action:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo mn -c ; sudo mn --controller remote --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow10

.. IMPORTANT:: As no specific topology configuration was passed to Mininet, it
    will generate a virtual network with a switch connecting two hosts, 10.0.0.1
    and 10.0.0.2. If you want friendly MAC addresses, add the --mac flag.

.. ATTENTION:: This NApp will NOT work in topologies containing loops. However,
    it works with linear and tree topologies.

Now, in the Mininet console, run:

.. code-block:: console

  mininet> h1 ping h2
  PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=83.3 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=66.6 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.495 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.117 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.114 ms

The pings are sucessful! Communication between the hosts is possible because the
*<username>/of_l2ls* NApp has dealt with the Flows. You can check it by looking at the controller
logs:

.. code-block:: console

  2017-07-25 16:04:07,150 - INFO [<username>/of_l2ls] (Thread-88) Packet received from 00:00:af:d5:38:98 to 00:00:1a:1e:9a:cf.

  2017-07-25 16:04:08,163 - INFO [<username>/of_l2ls] (Thread-94) Flow installed! Subsequent packets will be sent directly.

Once the flows are set in both directions, the switch sends the packets direclty.
Good job!
